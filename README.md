- [BEM Cheat Sheet](https://bem-cheat-sheet.9elements.com/) - A handy guide for naming CSS classes using the BEM (Block Element Modifier) methodology. It provides naming suggestions for common web components like cards, buttons, and forms, helping you maintain organized and scalable code.
- [Squoosh.app](https://squoosh.app/) - A free, browser-based image compression tool developed by GoogleChromeLabs. Squoosh allows you to compress and compare images with different codecs directly in your browser, ensuring your images are optimized without compromising quality.
- [Shots.so](https://shots.so/) - An online tool that enables you to create beautiful mockups quickly. Simply drag and drop your screenshots or designs, choose from various devices and backgrounds, and customize the appearance to suit your needs.
- [Normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) A modern, HTML5-ready alternative to CSS resets. It aims to make browsers render all elements more consistently and in line with modern standards. Unlike CSS resets, Normalize.css preserves useful default styles, establishes base styles for common elements, corrects browser bugs, and enhances accessibility. It provides a consistent baseline for styling HTML elements across different devices and browsers.
